    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use a grocery dataset provided on Carmen to find potential association rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this assignment are:\n",
    "- Practice the Association Analysis content we covered this semester.\n",
    "- Understand “why” the particular topics, techniques, etc., are important from a practical perspective.\n",
    "- Understand how to choose and use appropriate tools to solve the provided problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "- This workbook contains is a market basket dataset containing transactions.\n",
    "- The data file captures the data in \"long format\". Specifically, every row corresponds to the transaction id and the item. If the specific transaction id has multiple items, there will be multiple rows in the data.\n",
    "- You can process the data however you like, but it is recommended you convert into a one-hot-encoded data structure. This will allow you to easily use the mlxtend package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Business Problem\n",
    "- Assume this dataset contains all of the transactions for one month for our store.  We wish to find association rules that would improve our revenue as follows:\n",
    "  - We would discount one of our products by **10%** each month, with the hope that this would encourage customers to visit our store to purchase that product **8%** more frequently, and also purchase other products (that are not discounted) more frequently.\n",
    "- Practically speaking, we would like to come up with **two-item** rules (one antecedent and one consequent: (A -> B)) and choose the one that best adds to our revenues  (based on the rule support, confidence, etc.).\n",
    "- For simplicity, don't consider complex rule interactions (e.g., A->B and B->C, A->B and B->A, etc.).  Assume each rule is completely separate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proper Answers\n",
    "- **IMPORTANT:** **Show your work** and **explain it**.  This will help us give partial credit in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration\n",
    "For this assignment, you should work as an individual. You may informally discuss ideas with classmates, but your work should be your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Need to Turn In\n",
    "- Submit this Jupyter Notebook in .IPYNB format.  Do not \"zip\" the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Feel free to use the **mlxtend** package throughout this assignment.\n",
    "  - See: **https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/frequent_patterns/association_rules/#example-1-generating-association-rules-from-frequent-itemsets**\n",
